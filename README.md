# ✉️ AI-Powered Email Assistant  

## 📌 Project Overview  
The **AI-Powered Email Assistant** is a smart email reply generator that leverages the **Gemini API** to generate responses based on the email content. The assistant takes the email body as input via a request and produces contextually relevant replies in different tones, helping users compose emails efficiently.  

Additionally, a **Chrome Extension** has been developed to integrate this functionality into Gmail, allowing users to generate email responses directly within their inbox.  

## 🚀 Features  
✅ **AI-Generated Email Replies** – Generates relevant email responses based on the provided content.  
✅ **Multiple Tones** – Supports different tones like formal, casual, or concise responses.  
✅ **Seamless Integration** – Chrome extension adds a **'Generate'** button in Gmail for quick reply generation.  
✅ **Efficient Communication** – Saves time by reducing manual effort in composing emails.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Backend:** Spring Boot, Spring AI  
- **Frontend:** React.js (for Chrome extension UI)  
- **API:** Gemini AI

## 📂 How It Works  
1. The user selects or inputs an email body.  
2. The backend processes the request via the **Gemini API** and generates a response.
